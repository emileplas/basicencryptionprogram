# basicencryptionprogram

## About

In this project I created a basic encryption program in java. 

The user has (via the terminal) the option to create a (new) key, display the key, encrypt and decrypt messages with the previously generated key. 

The program can be exited pressing Q. 

## how it works:

After starting the program, the user will via the terminal be asked for instructions. If the user types:

- (N)ewKey: a new key will be generated;
- (G)etKey: the user will be able to view the key;
- (E)ncrypt: the user can enter a message that he/she wants to see encrypted;
- (D)ecrypt: the user can decrypt the previously generated message;
- (Q)uit: the program quits.
